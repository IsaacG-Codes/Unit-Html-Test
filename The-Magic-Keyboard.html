          <p class="paragraph-info">The Magic Keyboard is a wireless keyboard made specifically for the iPad. It can also be connected via bluetooth to other iPad versions such as the iPad Air and iPad Pro.
              The wireless Magic Keyboard included with your iMac has built-in features that make it easy to enter emoji, switch keyboard languages, lock your iMac, and perform many system functions with the touch of a key.
              This version of the Magic Keyboard includes a trackpad and attaches magnetically to compatible iPads, with the iPad sitting on a cantilever that allows the viewing angle to be adjusted. 
            Instead of a battery, it is powered directly by the attached iPad via that device's Smart Connector. 
            The keyboard also has a USB-C port on its hinge for recharging the attached iPad, allowing the USB-C port on the iPad to be used for connecting other accessories. 
              The Magic Keyboard has many customizable features: color changing, sizing adjustments, and different keyboards for different devices(such as iPad Air and iPad Pro.) Coloring options include black, white, and other colors. 
              Apple states:"It features an incredible typing experience and a trackpad that opens up new ways to work with iPadOS. The Magic Keyboard has a floating
              cantilever design, allowing you to attach iPad Pro and iPad Air magnetically and to smoothly adjust it to the perfect viewing angle for you."
              It also has front and back protection, to shield any incoming impact or if you drop it Your iPad will act just like a iMac! Your iPad becomes extremely light, portable laptop with the original iPad capabilities.</p>
