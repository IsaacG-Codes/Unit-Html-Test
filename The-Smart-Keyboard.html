        <p class="paragraph-info">The Smart Keyboard is a standalone hardware keyboard designed for the iPad Pro. 
          It is similar to a MacBook keyboard build into a Smart Cover, allowing it to serve as both a cover for the display, a stand, and a physical keyboard. 
          With keys covered in woven fabric, the Smart Keyboard is resistant to water and other liquids. Measuring in at 4mm, the Smart Keyboard does not include wires or standard keyboard components so it does not need to be charged. 
          Instead, it is powered by the Smart Connector, a new port that's found on the iPad Pro, and recent iPad and iPad Air models.</p>
