          <p class="paragraph-info">The Smart Keyboard was originally a standalone hardware keyboard designed for the iPad Pro. However, recent models of the Smart keyboard have allowed it to be functional with models of iPad Air from
              the 4th generation up until the recent models. The release of the first keyboard for iPads, the Smart Keyboard, was released in 2015 along with the iPad. This pair was very popular upon release, as the iPad was a large success
              and the Smart Keyboard was a major success along with the iPad itself respectufully. It is similar to a MacBook keyboard build into a Smart Cover, allowing it to serve as both a cover for the display, a stand, and a physical keyboard. 
            Many reviews of the Smart Keyboard revere this keyboard, praising the fluid and feeling of the keyboard. This demonstrates what a massive hit this was for apple. With keys covered in woven fabric, the Smart Keyboard is resistant to water and other liquids.
              Measuring in at 4mm, the Smart Keyboard does not include wires or standard keyboard components so it does not need to be charged. Instead, it is powered by the Smart Connector, a new port that's found on the iPad Pro, and recent iPad and iPad Air models.
              It's battery life is mainly dependent upon the iPad, utilizing the smart connector as the charger. Later innovations, such as the magic keyboard, would eventually overtake priority and be considered a better version leaving the smart keyboard
              with a close to its production.</p>
