          <p class="paragraph-info">The first-generation Apple Pencil was announced alongside the first iPad Pro on September 9, 2015. It communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth and has a removable cap that conceals a Lightning connector used for charging. The Pencil is compatible with the first- and second-generation iPad Pro models, and the sixth through tenth-generation iPad models (with the latter requiring a USB-C adapter).
            The second-generation Apple Pencil was announced on October 30, 2018, alongside the third-generation iPad Pro, and is used with most iPad models that contain a USB-C port (excluding the tenth-generation iPad). It uses a magnetic connector on the side of the tablet for charging rather than a Lightning connector, and includes touch-sensitive areas that can be tapped to perform actions within supported apps.
            Apple has promoted the Pencil as being oriented towards creative work and productivity;[7] during its unveiling, the Pencil's drawing capabilities were demonstrated using the mobile version of Adobe Photoshop,[8] and its document-annotation capabilities were shown on several Microsoft Office apps. The Apple Pencil has unique features including Apple Pencil Hover: "Apple Pencil hover shows you exactly where your 
              Apple Pencil will touch down on your display. So you can write, sketch, and illustrate with even greater precision. Watch apps and widgets expand on the Home Screen as you move over them. Preview your mark before you make it. See how your watercolors mix before you paint. Apple Pencil hover makes everything you do with Apple Pencil even more effortless." </p>
