  <p class="paragraph-info">The first-generation Apple Pencil was announced alongside the first iPad Pro on September 9, 2015. It communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth and has a removable cap that conceals a Lightning connector used for charging. The Pencil is compatible with the first- and second-generation iPad Pro models, and the sixth through tenth-generation iPad models (with the latter requiring a USB-C adapter).
    The second-generation Apple Pencil was announced on October 30, 2018, alongside the third-generation iPad Pro, and is used with most iPad models that contain a USB-C port (excluding the tenth-generation iPad). It uses a magnetic connector on the side of the tablet for charging rather than a Lightning connector, and includes touch-sensitive areas that can be tapped to perform actions within supported apps.
    Apple has promoted the Pencil as being oriented towards creative work and productivity;[7] during its unveiling, the Pencil's drawing capabilities were demonstrated using the mobile version of Adobe Photoshop,[8] and its document-annotation capabilities were shown on several Microsoft Office apps.</p>
