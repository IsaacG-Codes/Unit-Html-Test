        <p>Released in November 2015 alongside the iPad Pro (1st generation), the Smart Keyboard Folio is Apple's first keyboard cover accessory for iPad. 
          It is powered by the iPad's Smart Connector, and does not require separate charging or batteries. 
          It keys use a butterfly-switch mechanism, with its keys covered by a fabric material. 
          When unfolded, the Smart Keyboard only allows for one viewing angle position; when folded, the Smart Keyboard only protects the front of the iPad. 
          The Smart Keyboard is compatible with iPad Pro models from 2015 to 2017, the iPad Air (3rd generation), and iPad models from 2019 to 2021. 
          At release, it received criticism for its high price tag. 
          <br>
          An updated design, named Smart Keyboard Folio, was released alongside the iPad Pro (3rd generation), with support for two viewing angles and back protection. 
          The Smart Keyboard Folio is compatible with 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models from 2018 and later, and iPad Air models from 2020 and later.</p>
